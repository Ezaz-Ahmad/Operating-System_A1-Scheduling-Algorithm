In my COMP6240 assignment, I'm tasked with developing a program to simulate and analyze several scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SPN, PP, and PRR. My program calculates and lists process times and averages, comparing each algorithm's efficiency. Additionally, I'm implementing Round Robin scheduling for a dual processor system. This assignment, requiring Java programming, challenges me to strictly adhere to given input/output formats and utilize Java's standard libraries. The focus is on delivering console-based outputs that precisely match the provided sample formats.
